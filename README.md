# Daily Pulse

A tiny app that helps founders check in with themselves once a day and get a clear snapshot of how they're actually doing.

## What It Does

Instead of tracking everything, Daily Pulse asks just three quick questions:

- **How's your energy?**
- **How focused do you feel?**
- **How stressed are you?**

From those inputs, Daily Pulse generates:
- A simple visual summary with progress bars
- An overall "vibe" score
- A short, human-readable insight tailored to your current state

## How to Use

1. Open `index.html` in your browser
2. Move the sliders to rate your energy, focus, and stress (1-10)
3. Click "Get My Pulse"
4. Review your visual summary and personalized insight

## Features

- **Clean, modern interface** with a dark theme
- **Thoughtful insights** that adapt to your state (supportive when you're struggling, encouraging when you're thriving)
- **No data tracking** - everything stays local in your browser
- **Mobile-friendly** - works great on any device
- **Instant feedback** - see your results immediately

## Technical Details

Built with vanilla HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. No frameworks, no build process, no dependencies. Just open the file and go.

## For Founders

This tool was built with founders in mind. Building a company is hard, and it's easy to lose track of how you're actually doing. Daily Pulse helps you pause for a moment each day and check in with yourself.

The insights are designed to be:
- **Honest** when things are tough
- **Encouraging** without being dismissive
- **Actionable** with gentle suggestions
- **Compassionate** because you matter more than the work

Use it daily, weekly, or whenever you need a moment to reflect.
